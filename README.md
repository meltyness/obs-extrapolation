# obs-extrapolation
OBS Extrapolation is a script that is weird

It is primarily based on https://github.com/upgradeQ/OBS-Studio-Python-Scripting-Cheatsheet-obspython-Examples-of-API/blob/master/src/get_source_frame_data_ffi.py

It doesn't work very well, but it applies proportional control correlated with scene motion and some other really bad control stuff.

It badly needs to be refactored and it also crashes unpredictably under various circumstances that I can't explain.
